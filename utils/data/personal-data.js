  description: `I'm a Computer Science and Computer Engineering student who believes technology should make people's lives better. This became clear to me during a trip to Ethiopia, my home country, where I got to meet family and experience how powerful community and resilience can be. 

  Right now, I'm a Teaching Assistant helping 300+ students learn programming, and I love breaking down complex problems to help others succeed. I work with backend development, AI/ML, and cybersecurity, but what really drives me is building things that matter. I'm currently creating MomentumX, an app that helps teens support each other in building good habits and breaking bad ones.
  
  When I'm not coding, I'm babysitting, doing MMA, hanging out with friends and family, or writing poetry. These keep me grounded and remind me that the best technology brings people together instead of pulling them apart.
  
  My goal is to build startups or create devices that make a real difference in education, healthcare, and helping our planet. I want to either help grow an innovative startup or work at a company that cares about making positive change while still letting me build cool stuff on the side.
  
  What excites me about tech is that there's always something new to learn, you get to work with great teams, and you're in a unique position to actually solve important problems while building something meaningful.`,
